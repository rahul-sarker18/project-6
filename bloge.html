            <h2 class="text-center">1. var , let and const</h2>
            <p>Var can be used repeatedly with the same name. var can be modified. let cannot be used repeatedly with the same name but the value of let can be changed. const cannot be overwritten with the same name and cannot be changed.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center"> 2. Arrow function and regular function definition:</h2>
              <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center"> 3. map() filter() find() forEach</h2>
              <p>The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected element. It finds the element in the DOM tree by traversing through the root to leaf. The filter() method is used to filters all the elements and returns the element that matches and the element that do not match are removed.The main difference between map and forEach is that the map method returns a new array by applying the callback function on each element of an array, while the forEach method doesn't return anything. You can use the forEach method to mutate the source array, but this isn't really the way it's meant to be used. </p>

              <h2 class="text-center"> 4. Why use type string</h2>
              <p>A string data type is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally considered a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding</p>
